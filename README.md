# Deep-CNN-Autoencoder---Image-Compression
The repository is structured to provide an overview of the model architecture, training processes, and results, making it a valuable resource for those interested in learning and experimenting with deep learning techniques.

# Deep CNN Autoencoder - Image Compression - Denoising Image

# Project Information

An autoencoder is an unsupervised learning technique for neural networks that learns efficient data representations (encoding) by training the network to ignore signal “noise.” Autoencoders can be used for image denoising, image compression, and, in some cases, even generation of image data.

## Flow of Autoencoder

Input Image -> Encoder -> Compressed Representation -> Decoder -> Reconstruct Input Image
